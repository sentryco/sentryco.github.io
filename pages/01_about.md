### Autonomy

Our product enables you to manage your credentials on your own terms without any reliance on cloud services. This approach effectively **eliminates any risks** that is associated with centralised storage, such as weak encryption, human error, backdoors, or other issues that commonly affect cloud-based services.

### Verifiable

Our application has a simple premise - Your data is **never transmitted outside** of the devices you own. And you can **verify which services** the app connects to in Apple's own [App Privacy Rapport](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212958) feature in the settings menu of your device.  


### Longevity

Our application is **self-contained**. There is no server that might go down in the future. We have made over 30% of our application code available on our [GitHub page](GitHub.com/sentryco). And we pledge to make all of our code open-source if we should ever shift our company strategy from commercial to non-profit. We have also fully automated our deployment and [testing infrastructur](https://eon.codes/blog/2022/11/24/the-art-of-automating-qa/). This ensures that we can continue to provide our users with a reliable product **for years to come**.

Sincerely, The sentry team.
