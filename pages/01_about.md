### OpenSource

We have open-sourced over 20+ modules, with more being added regularly. Additionally, we offer bounties for challenges we aim to tackle but are constrained by time and resources. Explore these opportunities on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/sentryco) or contact us via email if you're feeling adventurous.

### Testing

We conduct local unit tests on all modules, triggered with each change. Local UI tests run continuously with randomized data for thorough coverage. For open-sourced modules, GitHub Actions automate unit testing and code quality checks. We also use AI-powered diff checks via [cursor.com](https://cursor.com/) for every commit and pull request to maintain consistent code quality.

### Mission

Our mission is to secure personal credentials with the same reliability and trust as good old fashion physical keys â€” 100% under your control and inaccessible to anyone else. And we want to do it with the devices you already have, completly without relying on [the cloud](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/22/23523322/lastpass-data-breach-cloud-encrypted-password-vault-hackers).
