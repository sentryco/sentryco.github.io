### What is it?
This is a custom Jekyll theme that was made for: [https://sentry.co](https://sentry.co)

### How does it work?
- Uses Jekyll + Markdown to manage content
- Can be hosted for free on github
- Can use custom domain from [namecheap.com](namecheap.com) etc
- Uses anonymised Google analytics (GDPR friendly)

### How do I get it?
- Fork it to your github account
- Change the content of the CNAME file to match your domain
- Test it at: [https://githubUserName.github.io/](https://githubUserName.github.io/)

### How do I use it?
- The index.md uses _layouts/wrapper.html contains the core structure (everything starts from here)
- Run the repo locally to develop or customize it further (see jekyll notes)
- Jekyll is a bit tricky to use, but its free and wordpress / webflow quickly gets complicated too when you want to do something custom

### Todo:
- Add subPages with more info ✅
- Make a blog section ✅
- Better fonts (rounded font for title-logo etc) Use google fonts
- Insert google analytics ID through the _config.yml
