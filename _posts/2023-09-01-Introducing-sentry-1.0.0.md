Introducing Sentry 1.0 (An offline password manager for macOS and iOS) <!--more-->

After 3 years of building in stealth (10k+ dev hours, with more than $400.000 in funding) our moonshot technology is finally seeing the light of day.

## How are we changing the game?
We invented a new way of exchanging data locally, that is both automatic and happens in the background even when your devices are in standby. Which is perfect for managing passwords. Data you shouldn't store or transfer online, but need to have available on all your devices.
