/*
Fix: 
- You could rename the .vid selector to something more descriptive, such as .video-container, to make it easier to understand its purpose.
- You could rename the .image_box selector to something more descriptive, such as .bezel-image-container, to make it easier to understand its purpose.
- You could rename the .video_box selector to something more descriptive, such as .video-container, to make it easier to understand its purpose.
- You could consider using CSS variables for the colors to make it easier to change them later on.
- You could also consider using a more consistent naming convention for the colors, such as using all lowercase letters and separating words with hyphens.
